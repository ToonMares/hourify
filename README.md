# hourify
One super short vid duplicated and concatenated for a length of 1 hr. IT CAN BE CHANGED!


Put the video into the folder you have main.py, open the app, and type "./video.mp4" (video = the name of ur vid)
You need moviepy for this to work!

Process:

The user inputs the video, after it's duplicated to be (not exactly) 1 hour and it cuts the last part so it is exactly one hour, after it concatenates the videos.

HAVE FUN!
